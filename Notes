- ok, so we pulled the database folder from our project and put it into this workout log backend file, now we can delete the database
folder and edit the index and package.json files to what we need
- so, we seem to have run into an issue, this workoutlog uses get, post, put, and delete requests already, so how do we get it to render
the home page? wait a minute, the backend doesn't render anything right? we shouldn't need or want to render anything with the backend,
so I think the current code is fine as is?
- if the current backend code is fine, let's create an app for it, so we can test it with our frontend heroku local and put the app
address into the frontend server variable.
